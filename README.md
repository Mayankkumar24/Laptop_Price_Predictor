Laptop Price Predictor

Welcome to the Laptop Price Predictor project! This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features using machine learning techniques. 
I have utilized three different machine learning models. Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, 
to predict laptop prices with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores.
Linear Regression: Achieved an MAE of 0.88
Random Forest: Achieved an MAE of 0.91
Decision Tree: Achieved an MAE of 0.83

Tech Used
Python: Primary programming language used for development.
NumPy: For numerical computing and array manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
pickle: For serializing and deserializing Python objects.
Streamlit: For creating and deploying the web application.
Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

Deployment
The model hasbeen deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and usage. someone can access the web application here.
